import { Game, Grid } from "../main/example";

// The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
// each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated,
// respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
// horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions
// occur:
//     Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
//     Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
//     Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
//     Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
//
// These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into
// the following:
//     Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
//     Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
//     All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
